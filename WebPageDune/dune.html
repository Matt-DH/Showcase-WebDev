    <p>“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. 
        Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. 
        I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. 
        And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. 
        Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”</p>
